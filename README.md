# Bubba
Bubba is a ChatBot WebApp in which you can talk, interact and teach it to learn new things.

## Introduction
I used a Python library called [ChatterBot](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot) for the bot response calculations

So it learns based on your chats, as well as you can teach it to respond as you wish to your inputs

It is filled with jokes and good sense of humor, you can ask for jokes and facts and it will probably get you some laughs

It was trained with a long custom conversation database I made myself for it to be able to talk before any teachings

It is deployed on https://rayan-chatbot.herokuapp.com/

I have a video explaining it on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtXp3G9IdZ4

It was made entirely using only Python, HTML and CSS languages.

## Installation
You can just clone it to your machine

Make sure you have all the requirements from `requirements.txt`

If you already satisfy the python version needed, you may just run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
to install the rest

And run the following command on the app directory
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
to run the application

## Contributing
