# Bubba
Bubba is a ChatBot WebApp in which you can talk, interact and teach it to learn new things.

It is deployed on https://rayan-chatbot.herokuapp.com/

I have a video explaining it on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtXp3G9IdZ4

It was made entirely using only Python, HTML and CSS languages.

## Installation
You can just clone it to your machine

make sure you have all the requirements from requirements.txt

and run the following command on the app directory
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
